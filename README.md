# Zwanenberg Food Group TransparantieTool

## Introduction
Zwanenberg Food Group requires from all meat suppliers to publish their transparancy information of the supply chain.  The prefered way to provide this information to Zwanenberg is by publishing this information in GS1 fTrace (https://web.ftrace.com/en/). In the situation that GS1 fTrace cannot be used, Zwanenberg can receive the transparancy information via a direct connection.

### via GS1 fTrace
You can publish the GTIN of the products that you sell to Zwanenberg Food Group to GS1 fTrace.
After publishing you can release the information (when, what, where) of the chain (origin, slaughtering, splitting, sending) to the GLN of Zwanenberg (08710581000017).

For every batch/lot you send to Zwanenberg you need to update the information in fTrace.

For every delivery to a Zwanenberg plant you need to upload one XML file with the requested information. You can upload the XML via sFTP to our servers. Information about the sFTP connection will be provided to you after both parties have agreed about using this method instead and tested the first XML.

## XML
The information requested by Zwanenberg needs to be provided in a structered XML file.

This XML has the following structure:

- a **SUPPLIER** 
- delivers to a **RECEIVER**  
- one or more **PRODUCTS**
- Each **PRODUCT** has one or more **BATCHES**
- Each **BATCH** has 
- one or more **ORIGINS** where the meat was sourced from (farm)
- one or more **SLAUGHTERINGS** where the animal was slaughtered
- optional: one or more **SPLITTINGS** with internal procession steps
- optional: one or more **HANDOVERS** with combining internal batches to the final batch

## XSD
  
The XML needs to be validated to the XSD. You can validate your test XML with the TransparantieTool XSD e.g. at https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html

The XSD contains also additional information for each tag.
