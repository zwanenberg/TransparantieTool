# TransparantieTool
Zwanenberg Food Group requires from all meat suppliers to publish their transparancy information of the chain.  The prefered way to provide this information to Zwanenberg is by publishing the information in fTrace (https://web.ftrace.com/en/). After publishing the supplier can release the information (when, what, where) of the chain (origin, slaughtering, splitting) to the GLN of Zwanenberg (08710581000017).

In the situation that fTrace cannot be used, Zwanenberg can receive the transparancy information via a direct connection.

For every delivery to a Zwanenberg plant you need to upload one XML file with the requested information.
You can upload via sFTP. Information about sFTP connection will be provided to you after both parties have agreed about using this method.

The XML will be validated to the XSD.
